# Credit-Roll-SAMMI
Credit Roll ported to SAMMI by RoadieGamer, originally by Lioran

Make sure you are on SAMMI 2022.4.3 and up, OBSWS 4.9.1 or 5.0.1 and up for their versions and your OBS is open before installing.

- After install you can delete the First time run button if install was sucessful.
- You can adjust all settings in the settings button, take a look around to see what is editable.
- If you accidently delete something in the settings button I have a default button seperate so that you can just import that JSON
- To start the credit roll click the BIG RED BUTTON! 
- To end the credit roll you can click stop credit roll or press to stop all and delete credits
- The latter will delete the current information that the credit roll has for your stream. It is a good way to prep for a stream if you were testing things beforehand
- Restore CSV's from backup will restore the last working data in the case of LB2 crashing or windows crashing.   /$global.main_directory$/\Credit Roll  
- When SAMMI is properly closed. It moves the current backup to the backup folder inside /$global.main_directory$/\Credit Roll\old and deletes the old backup data

Happy streaming everyone!
