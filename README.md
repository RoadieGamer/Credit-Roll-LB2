# Credit-Roll-LB2
Credit Roll for LB2 

Make sure you are on LB 2.07 and up, OBSWS 4.9.1 and your OBS is open before installing.

- After install you can delete the First time run button if install was sucessful.
- You can adjust all settings in the settings button, take a look around to see what is editable.
- If you accidently delete something in the settings button I have a default button seperate so that you can just import that JSON
- To start the credit roll click the BIG RED BUTTON! 
- To end the credit roll you can click stop credit roll or press to stop all and delete credits
- The latter will delete the current information that the credit roll has for your stream. It is a good way to prep for a stream if you were testing things beforehand
- Restore CSV's from backup will restore the last working data in the case of LB2 crashing or windows crashing.   /$global.main_directory$/credit roll  
- When LB2 is properly closed. It moves the current backup to the backup folder inside $global.main_directory$/\Credit Roll\old and deletes the old backup data

Happy streaming everyone!
